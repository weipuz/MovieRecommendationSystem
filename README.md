# Movie Recommendation System
This is a MapReduce and HBase application for serveal features in a Movie Recommendation System.
It contains two main part:
- 1. Movie similiarity analyze based on user ratings
- 2. Movie and User dependency analyze based on movie's genres and user's gender, occupation and age group.

It also contains several utility functions to help process the raw data and analyze the results:
- 1. ETL codesï¼šextract and transform the raw data such as UserInfo, MovieInfo, MovieRating, into HBase tables.
- 2. Client codes to quary and report the results in HBase tables, such as search and return the top 10 similar movies of a given movie;
- 3. Client codes to transform the output in HBase to csv files as report.

###The data: 
We use the follow datasets:

1. Movie Tweeting dataset. The dataset was collected by Simon Dooms4 by processing public tweets on Twitter and it contains 100,000 anonymous ratings of approximately 10,000 movies made by 16,000 users.  https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings
2. Larger dataset from MovieLens: 1 million rating dataset from: http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-1m.zip.
